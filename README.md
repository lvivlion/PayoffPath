PayoffPath requires the storage permission to save your loan settings (such as original balance, interest rate, and payment history) and user preferences locally on your device. This ensures your data persists across sessions so you don’t have to manually re-enter your mortgage or loan details every time you visit your lender’s dashboard, allowing for a seamless, automated tracking and simulation experience.

activeTab justification
The activeTab permission is used to grant the extension temporary access to the currently focused tab when the user interacts with the extension. This allows PayoffPath to scan the lender's webpage for loan balances and interest rates only upon explicit user request. It ensures that the extension only interacts with financial data when you intend to use its simulation features, maintaining a privacy-first approach.



scripting justification
The scripting permission is required to programmatically inject the PayoffPath simulation dashboard and custom styling directly into the lender's webpage via the Shadow DOM. This allows the extension to provide a premium, integrated overlay that calculates interest savings and payoff trajectories in real-time as you interact with the page, creating a seamless experience without requiring you to switch between tabs.

Host permission justification
PayoffPath is a universal loan assistant designed to work across hundreds of different banking and lending platforms. Since mortgages and loans are hosted on a vast array of domains—from large national banks to local credit unions—it is impossible to maintain a fixed list of sites. Broad host access is necessary to allow the extension to identify and scan for relevant financial data on whichever secure lender portal the user is currently logged into.
